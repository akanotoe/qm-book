# Relativistic Quantum Mechanics
Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics follows the Schr√∂dinger Equation,

$$
i\hbar \dfrac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t} = -\dfrac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\Psi + V\Psi.
$$

The reason this equation is nonrelativistic is because space and time are treated unequally.
In the language of differential equations, it is *first* order in time and *second* order in space.
A truly relativistic equation would put time and space on equal footing.
